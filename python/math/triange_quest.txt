Triangle Quest 1
----------------

1
22
333
4444
55555

    1 = 1 x (1)
   22 = 2 x (11)
  333 = 3 x (111)
 4444 = 4 x (1111)
55555 = 5 x (11111)

1111... = 1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + ...
This is a geometric series

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)
â€‹
where,
  S = sum of the first n terms of the series.
  a = first term.
  r = common ratio.
  n = number of terms.

for this problem,
  a = 1
  r = 10
  n = n

S = (10^n - 1) / 9
